  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last three years, I worked for an Australian Telco - having been a founding member of a tiny team tasked with the delivery of short, sweet web apps that can be delivered quickly, and will resolve &#8220;low hanging fruit&#8221; business problems.  The team was created to rapidly respond to smaller business problems that were often overlooked, or subject to inappropriate costs as they were forced through a large project lifecycle.</p>

<p>The idea was simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>deliver high value and incur low cost - use open source MVC framework, OS and Database (LAMP)</li>
<li>minimise overheads - one developer paired with the customer&#8217;s single representative</li>
<li>focus on delivery of small scope iterations and highest quality - 4 weeks to deliver a functional application</li>
<li>charge nothing to the business for application development and hosting</li>
</ol>


<p>For a low operational cost (4 developers and 9 virtual machines running a LAMP stack), the team continues to deliver on all fronts.</p>

<p>For those interested, I have elaborated elsewhere about the <a href="/2011/02/Agile-Corporate/">business justifications</a> for this team.</p>

<p>We had three tenets:</p>

<ul>
<li>integrate with nothing - build standalone apps (exception here is the integration with the company LDAP directory for SSO)</li>
<li>never build a public facing application - your work lives on the intranet alone</li>
<li>ensure you can deliver something useful and of value in maximum 4 weeks</li>
</ul>


<p>For those interested, I have elaborated elsewhere about the <a href="/2011/02/Technology-Agile-Corporate/">technology used</a> by this team.</p>

<p>I finished my tenure with the Express Solutions team on the 27th of January, 2011.  I will miss the team, our leaders and our customers.  Three years is a long time to do the same thing, and I have decided to move on in the spirit of challenging myself to continuously improve and learn.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a brain dump of the things I have learned.</p>

<ul>
<li>Work for engaged customers.  There is no better partner than one who is motivated to deliver something of high value.</li>
<li>Build a team of &#8220;(external) polymaths&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath.  People who can write great code are not enough.  They should be articulate, communicative and able to manage complex delivery.</li>
<li>Quality is everything.  A four week deliverable will never be lauded as huge success unless it works beautifully on day one.</li>
<li>Reuse is paramount.  Effort is cost - and it makes no sense to repeat your effort.</li>
<li>Remove administrative overheads.  Automate the creation of infrastructure, and empower yourself to impose change easily, safely and regularly.</li>
<li>Move fast and be smart.  Deliver something small every day if possible - especially in a 4 week life cycle.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, about a year ago, I put in place a plan that sees me take the next step in my professional career.</p>

<p>I signed up for a business partnership with a focused, motivated and very decent <a href="http://twitter.com/danfowlie">individual</a> and together we strive to do the above, and with a pretty interesting toolkit at our disposal.  More about this later&#8230;for now feel free to check out our <a href="http://trineo.co.nz">company website</a>.</p>

<p>Suffice to say - Express Solutions is a team that means a lot to me - and I respectfully single out two great mates and colleagues.  <a href="http://twitter.com/sherifmansour">eHabib</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/jmasson">Massive</a> were my partners in the creation of the team, and I sincerely hope our paths continue to cross in many adventures.</p>

<p>Onwards&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing from my previous post about <a href="/2011/01/Milestones/">agile development in the corporate context</a>, I will point out the ways in which the team was structured and backed financially - in the context of the goals that were set for us.</p>

<p>Essentially, the creation of a small agile team was a PR exercise to demonstrate to business that IT still responded quickly and with quality.</p>

<p>The difficulty that we were to try to overcome was the inappropriate application of large scale project costs and timelines to smaller requests from business.  Usually, just the ramp up cost of any IT project would instantly negate the benefit of a small to medium sized business project.</p>

<p>Some essentials:</p>

<ul>
<li>We were tasked to deliver 50 web applications of varying complexity in one year.</li>
<li>The team was fully funded so we were not seeking to constantly capitalise our work.</li>
<li>The team was therefore not required to charge for our work.</li>
</ul>


<p>So the IT organisation subsidised the team&#8217;s salaries, and infrastructure requirements - so as to focus exclusively on delivery as opposed to bureaucracy.</p>

<p>The other and perhaps most important aspect to all of this is that the team was backed by the CIO.  Although he set a challenging goal, he also cleared the path for us to quickly build the required infrastructure and gave us the autonomy to decide how we would achieve the goals set.  A rare and incredible opportunity for us!</p>

<p>Motivated by the need to simply add value - we built a cheap and high quality open source infrastructure, and then proceeded to meet the challenges that were set.</p>

<p>A simple example of our work would be two weeks spent building an application which would scan workloads of a provisioning team, and prompt team members when critical dates were being approached so that customer service KPI&#8217;s were met.  This took 2 weeks or 10 working days to build - at a calculated expense of $10K, and saved the business $147K per annum.  This ROI calculation was based primarily on time saved on a weekly basis - not to mention the clear improvements in customer service as the provisioning team stayed on top of their work and their timely communications with customers in case of delay.
The &#8220;free&#8221; nature of the service was quickly pounced upon and some attempts were made to exploit our model.  We dealt with this by setting a maximum of 4 weeks to be spent on any deliverable.  So if we were asked to do a 6 month project for free - we would politely decline.  Usually, the cost associated with a 6 month deliverable would motivate the business to descope heavily, until they did fit within our model.  This didn&#8217;t happen all the time, however when it did, the business walked away with much of their desired functionality and an actual solution as opposed to a design or concept.</p>
