  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished a two week trip to the US, spending most of my time in Boulder Colorado, and San Francisco.</p>

<p>Most of the time in San Francisco was spent at Dreamforce meeting with the small, but growing group of developers who build bespoke applications that integrate with Salesforce.com.  The most notable part of this experience was the chance to actually meet in person so many people who I have talked to over skype or over email, or via pull requests on github.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s really no substitute to meeting people in person, and I left San Francisco that much more in tune and in touch with the community.  I missed Metallica &#8230; yes &#8230; but um I saw a car that sends microblogs to its owner.  Dreamforce brought home to me the scale at which things happen in the US, and the kind of engagement and enthusiasm that people show towards their vocation.</p>

<p>I then attended Rocky Mountain Ruby in Boulder, an experience that could not be more different than that of Dreamforce.  200 attendees, as opposed 45000.  A single track conference held in a lovely old theatre, as opposed to a smorgasboard of options held across multiple city blocks.  Both were fun and professionally constructive, but I really identified with and enjoyed the Ruby conference a little more.</p>

<p>Delivering a superb event, Marty Haught ran the conference really well.  We were entertained, educated, watered, beered, and fed.  A really excellent conference.</p>

<p>I have always had an affinity with Boulder, and I got to stick around for a week after the conference.  My friend Damien (friendly Frenchman based in Sydney) and I rode mountain bikes, exploring some awesome trails.  We sampled some awesome food and drank some really amazing boutique microbrew beer.  Get there, its a great town.  I am coming back for sure - perhaps to stay for a while.</p>

<p>During the week, I met with about 7 or 8 businesses that are all creating something new.  Small companies, tech startups, with a small footprint and an audacious goal.  A significant observation about Boulder is that it is full of enterprising folk.  From Celestial Seasonings Tea, to Crocs, to some of the best little tech startups around.  Oh and I believe the US atomic clock lives in Boulder&#8230;sweet.</p>

<p>Between the people, the tech, the trails, the beer, the food and the beer, I was really taken by the town.  My heartfelt thanks to those who made it such an awesome stay.  I hope that you guys will remember the dude from NZ that turned up, and know you&#8217;re always welcome out our way.</p>

<p>Heading home, we made the mandatory pilgrimmage to REI (as all Antipodeans do), and visited a great friend of mine who lives near Denver.  A lovely evening of more fine company, food and you guessed it &#8230; microbrew beer.</p>

<p>Sitting at SFO airport now, getting set to board the plane.  I&#8217;m dying to see my family - being away from them has been the toughest part of the journey, however I got to do my thing, and I reckon that our little family will be better off for it in the long term &#8230;</p>

<time datetime="2011-02-09T22:17:00+11:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 9<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I spent a lot of time <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-cherry-pick.html">cherry picking</a> my way through a bunch of commits.</p>

<p>Before explaining further - this is the scenario we were in.</p>

<ul>
<li>over about 3 weeks we&#8217;ve had to vendor a Ruby gem so as to modify and extend it rapidly in our Rails app</li>
<li>we&#8217;ve done this quickly and without tracking changes in a fork of the gem (bad!)</li>
<li>we needed to contribute all our work back to the gem maintainer but we needed to carefully group related commits, and send meaningful pull requests</li>
</ul>


<p>So, after forking the gem in question and a cheeky bit of diffing we knew the all the differences between our vendorised gem and that of the fork.</p>

<pre><code>diff -uNrw . our/app/vendor/gems/gem_name/ | less
</code></pre>

<p>We created a temp branch and applied all the diffs by simply copying over the entire gem recursively.</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b temp
cp -r our/rails_app/vendor/gems/gem_name/ .
</code></pre>

<p>We ran all the tests in the gem, and gladly they passed, so we removed our vendor gem directory from our application - using a symbolic link instead pointing at the gem fork.  Then we ran all our tests in our application and they passed too - which is great.</p>

<p>So at this point, the gem was still in the vendor/gems directory, however this pointed to a fork of the gem where many changes had been made.</p>

<p>The next step was to commit or interactively add hunks of code from all the changes in the temp branch.</p>

<pre><code>git commit -v file
git add -i file
</code></pre>

<p>This created neatly separated commits of all changes in our temp branch.</p>

<p>Then we checked out the master branch and compared the temp branch to the HEAD revision.  This showed us clearly the differences between the two branches.</p>

<pre><code>git checkout master
git diff HEAD..temp
</code></pre>

<p>So, we&#8217;ve got all our commits on a temp branch and these needed to be selectively added to new branches, allowing us to logically aggregate changes, and issue pull requests to the gem&#8217;s maintainer.</p>

<p>So - first up create a new branch and then we started to cherry pick.</p>

<pre><code>git checkout master
git checkout -b new_set_of_commits_for_pull_request
</code></pre>

<p>With a list of SHAs generated from all commits on the temp branch we could tell what we needed to cherry pick.</p>

<pre><code>git log --oneline temp
</code></pre>

<p>So applying these commits to a branch is easy - giving us a branch with a specified set of commits on it.</p>

<pre><code>git cherry-pick 42f169a 9068c89 750684e d5a7ac8
</code></pre>

<p>Then we push this branch, and follow github&#8217;s amazing pull request procedure.</p>

<pre><code>git push origin new_set_of_commits_for_pull_request
</code></pre>

<p>Once our changes were accepted (phew!) we created a remote pointing to the gem repo, and fetched the contents.  Then we tracked all upstream changes to this gem allowing us to merge back all upstream changes into our local master branch - using an intermediate &#8220;integrate&#8221; branch to test that all merges were fast-forwards.</p>

<pre><code>git remote add gem_name &lt;insert repo&gt;
git fetch gem_name
git branch --track gem_name gem_name/master
</code></pre>

<p>Git is such a powerful SCM - it&#8217;ll take me a while to get my head around the possibilities.  For me, to write the above down is really important - it helps me to remember for next time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So what would you do?  You&#8217;re riding home to see your 4 month old son and your lovely wife, in traffic and doing all the right things - obeying all the rules.</p>

<p>The car next to you cuts hard across you, no indication, turning into a side street without being in a turning lane.</p>

<p>You touch the side of the car and glance off at pace trying your best to correct and turn away from any obstacles, hit the curb and go flying over your bike as it lands on you while you skid and scrape your way along the hard footpath&#8230;</p>

<p>Sort of like sliding along a cheesegrater at speed.  You bounce hard but you&#8217;re OK and you stand up quickly to assess the damage - you&#8217;re OK - this is amazing.</p>

<p>Then the guy driving the car jumps out, and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I made a late decision, didn&#8217;t check, didn&#8217;t indicate and this is all my fault - can I do anything to help?&#8221;.</p>

<p>A motorcyclist comes running over after seeing everything and exclaims, &#8220;That was a serious hit mate are you OK? Do we need to call an ambulance?&#8221;.  I&#8217;m still standing, shaken and stirred and bleeding but &#8230; I&#8217;ve had worse falls and thankfully all is well.</p>

<p>My reaction was not one of anger - this person openly apologises and claims responsibility for his actions, as opposed to the many others on the roads who would probably have just driven away.</p>

<p>I almost felt awkward asking the guy to pay for damage to my gear, and my bike.</p>

<p>Not the best thing to happen to me - I&#8217;m sore and I can&#8217;t sleep well because one side of my body is pretty banged up but I will heal, and he is genuinely sorry for this.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m thankful for his approach, and I call him when I get home (I insisted on riding home) and let him know that things are fine.  I&#8217;m so glad to see my family.</p>

<p>He will most certainly pay more attention, and I will ride more defensively given what is at stake.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll probably make a friend after this is all done.</p>
