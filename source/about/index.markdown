I’m Abhinav and I live in the beautiful city of Christchurch, New Zealand. I’ve lived in and travelled through various parts of the world, and I moved to Christchurch for the superb lifestyle…

I'm surrounded by some great people of diverse backgrounds, and in various fields and pursuits. I work in the web software industry, and I'm a cyclist and climber.  I also recently became a Dad which raises the bar to another level.

I operate with a simple motto – be virtuous in your actions.
